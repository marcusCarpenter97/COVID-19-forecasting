# The effects of regularization on RNN models for time series forecasting:  Covid-19 as an example 
This repository contains the code for the paper *The effects of regularisation on RNN models for Covid-19 time series
forecasting*.

The paper can be found [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9719662).

## How to run the experiments?
`python3 run_experiments.py`
All results and data files are saved in the folder `cross_val_results`. When run, the program will download the newest
data from the Jonhs Hopkins GitHub repository automatically. The code was tested on the Ubuntu 18.04 WSL.

## How to view the results?
`python3 result_viewer.py` 

## What is the `cross_val_results` folder?
All output files generated by the experiments will be saved here. The files provided were used to analyse the models in
the research paper. Rerunning the experiments will overwrite these. The file named `country_names.csv` is created by running the
command `python3 process_results.py`.

## What is the `kaggle_data` folder?
The population data for the countries is extracted from the data provided by
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/covid19-global-forecasting-week-5/).
